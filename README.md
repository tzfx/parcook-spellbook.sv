# parcook-spellbook.sv

This is a tool to help out the 5e D&D classes that need to prepare spells at the start of every adventuring day.

It's built in [svelte](https://svelte.dev).

You can find a live deployment of it on github pages at: <https://tzfx.github.io/parcook-spellbook.sv/>

## Development

As per usual, install dependencies with `npm ci`, and then use `npm run dev` to create a live server.
