For Svelte+TypeScript users,\n * you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:\n * ```ts\n * import { SvelteComponentTyped } from \"svelte\";\n * export class MyComponent extends SvelteComponentTyped<{foo: string}> {}\n * ```\n * Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension\n * to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file\n * with TypeScript:\n * ```svelte\n * <script lang=\"ts\">\n * \timport { MyComponent } from \"component-library\";\n * </script>\n * <MyComponent foo={'bar'} />\n * ```\n *\n * #### Why not make this part of `SvelteComponent(Dev)`?\n * Because\n * ```ts\n * class ASubclassOfSvelteComponent extends SvelteComponent<{foo: string}> {}\n * const component: typeof SvelteComponent = ASubclassOfSvelteComponent;\n * ```\n * will throw a type error, so

The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away.

If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\",\n            \"The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\",\n        ],\n        miscTags: [\"SGT\"],\n        classes: {\n            fromClassList: [\n                {\n                    name: \"Bard\",\n                    source: \"PHB\",\n                },\n                {\n                    name: \"Wizard\",\n                    source: \"PHB\",\n                },\n                {\n                    name: \"Artificer (Revisited)\",\n                    source: \"UAArtificerRevisited\",\n                },\n                {\n                    name: \"Artificer\",\n                    source: \"TCE\",\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n        races: [\n            {\n                name: \"Gnome (Mark of Scribing)\",\n                source: \"ERLW\",\n                baseName: \"Gnome\",\n                baseSource: \"PHB\",\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Magic Weapon\",\n        source: \"PHB\",\n        page: 257,\n        srd: true,\n        basicRules: true,\n        level: 2,\n        school: \"T\",\n        time: [\n            {\n                number: 1,\n                unit: \"bonus\",\n            },\n        ],\n        range: {\n            type: \"point\",\n            distance: {\n                type: \"touch\",\n            },\n        },\n        components: {\n            v: true,\n            s: true,\n        },\n        duration: [\n            {\n                type: \"timed\",\n                duration: {\n                    type: \"hour\",\n                    amount: 1,\n                },\n                concentration: true,\n            },\n        ],\n        entries: [\n            \"You touch a nonmagical weapon.

A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.\",\n        ],\n        damageInflict: [\"psychic\"],\n        savingThrow: [\"intelligence\"],\n        abilityCheck: [\"intelligence\"],\n        affectsCreatureType: [\n            \"aberration\",\n            \"beast\",\n            \"celestial\",\n            \"dragon\",\n            \"elemental\",\n            \"fey\",\n            \"fiend\",\n            \"giant\",\n            \"humanoid\",\n            \"monstrosity\",\n            \"ooze\",\n            \"plant\",\n        ],\n        miscTags: [\"SGT\"],\n        classes: {\n            fromClassList: [\n                {\n                    name: \"Bard\",\n                    source: \"PHB\",\n                },\n                {\n                    name: \"Sorcerer\",\n                    source: \"PHB\",\n                },\n                {\n                    name: \"Wizard\",\n                    source: \"PHB\",\n                },\n            ],\n            fromSubclass: [\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Archfey\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Great Old One\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Noble Genie (UA)\",\n                        source: \"UA2020SubclassesPt1\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Genie (UA)\",\n                        source: \"UA2020SubclassesRevisited\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Undead (UA)\",\n                        source: \"UA2020SubclassesPt4\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Genie\",\n                        source: \"TCE\",\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    class: {\n                        name: \"Warlock\",\n                        source: \"PHB\",\n                    },\n                    subclass: {\n                        name: \"Undead\",\n                        source: \"VRGR\",\n                    },\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Phantasmal Killer\",\n        source: \"PHB\",\n        page: 265,\n        srd: true,\n        level: 4,\n        school: \"I\",\n        time: [\n            {\n                number: 1,\n                unit: \"action\",\n            },\n        ],\n        range: {\n            type: \"point\",\n            distance: {\n                type: \"feet\",\n                amount: 120,\n            },\n        },\n        components: {\n            v: true,\n            s: true,\n        },\n        duration: [\n            {\n                type: \"timed\",\n                duration: {\n                    type: \"minute\",\n                    amount: 1,\n                },\n                concentration: true,\n            },\n        ],\n        entries: [\n            \"You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.
